		At Partners for Our Children, we like data. We especially like making visualizations for people to better understand the data. We admit this parallel coordinates plot isn’t exactly intuitive, but once you learn how to use, manipulate and read it, you’ll like it. Trust us.

	<h2> Why does this county comparison tool matter? </h2>
	<p>
		Before we go into details of what a parallel coordinates plot actually is, let us first answer the most important question: <strong>why does a county comparison tool matter?</strong> There are many reasons. One reason is because it can be very beneficial to see how different regions or counties compare to one another. If some have a very high <a href="http://review.partnersforourchildren.org/child-well-being/glossary#Family_Reunification">reunification</a> rate and lower median length of stay, are those counties doing something differently to achieve these positive outcomes for children? Or perhaps you want to see how counties with high poverty rates compare? The bottom line is that you will be able to see how different areas of the state stack up against one another and assess if there are any lessons that can be learned (based on differences in practice and policy) to improve local outcomes for children. 
	</p>
	<h2> What is a parallel coordinates plot? </h2>
	<p>
		Basically, it’s a visualization of a complex spreadsheet which allows you to quickly understand how things compare across several different factors. In our parallel coordinates plot, we show you how the state and all 39 counties compare on select child welfare measures, as well as basic demographic data. Rather than display several different graphs for each measure, this plot tells a much more comprehensive story of how the system is working from county to county. The featured measures include:

	<h2> How do you use the parallel coordinates plot? </h2>
	
	<h3> Highlight by Region on Graph </h3>
	<p>
		At the top, you can click on one or more of the regions to see the related data highlighted on the graph below. Simply click the box again to remove highlighted data. Note: The state average is highlighted by default.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Highlight by Data Line on Graph </h3>
	<p>
		If you are interested in a specific county data line, simply click on the line to highlight. Based on the color, you’ll know which region it falls under and can easily identify by referencing the chart below. In addition, you can deselect lines by clicking them again. After selecting a region(s), you can also deselect lines by clicking on them.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Highlight by Section on Graph </h3>
	<p>
		You can select a sub-section on any axis to highlight counties that fall within that section by clicking on the axis and "brushing", dragging up or down. The chart below will subsequently load only the highlighted county data. To remove the highlight, click on the same axis outside the highlight section. For instance, want to know which counties have a median length of stay less than 400 days? Click on the graph at 400 days and drag down and the graph will highlight the associated county data lines and the chart will populate the associated counties.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Moving Axes on Graph </h3>
	<p>
		If you would prefer to see one specific axis (measure) next to another, you can click on the axis label and drag left or right. For instance, if you would prefer to see “Annual Entries” next to “Reunification”, simply click on “Reunification” and drag to the left – placing it next to “Annual Entries”.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Highlight Data on Chart </h3>
	<p>
		On the chart below the graph, users can click on any county line to see the associated county data line highlighted in the graph above. Click the line again to remove highlight. You are also able to sort the data in the chart by any factor. For instance, want to then know which counties have the fewest children? Click on the “Population Under 18” column in the chart and you’ll see smallest to largest population. Click again to see largest to smallest.
